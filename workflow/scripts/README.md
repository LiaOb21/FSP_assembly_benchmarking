## Output Description

### üìä **Visualization Plots (6-panel layout)**

#### **Panel 1: Coverage Distribution Histogram**
- Shows frequency distribution of coverage depths across contigs
- Vertical lines indicate mean, median, and peak coverage
- Helps identify coverage uniformity and outliers

- X-axis: Contig length (log scale)
- Y-axis: Coverage depth
- Color: Coverage percentage (viridis colormap)
- Shows relationship between contig size and coverage

#### **Panel 3: Cumulative Coverage Distribution**
- Cumulative count of contigs vs coverage depth
- Reference lines for mean and median coverage
- Useful for understanding coverage distribution shape

#### **Panel 4: Contig Length Distribution**
- Histogram of contig lengths (log scale)
- Red line at 250bp threshold (common quality cutoff)
- Shows assembly fragmentation characteristics

#### **Panel 5: Coverage Statistics Panel**
- Text summary of key coverage metrics
- Assembly information and quality indicators
- Centered display with enhanced formatting

#### **Panel 6: Quality & Mapping Metrics Panel**
- Mapping statistics (if flagstat provided)
- Base and mapping quality scores
- Read distribution information

### üìã **Summary Statistics File**

Contains all calculated metrics in text format:
```

## Key Metrics Explained

### **Coverage Metrics**
- **Mean Coverage**: Simple average of all contig coverages
- **Weighted Mean Coverage**: Average weighted by contig length (more representative)
- **Overall Coverage %**: Percentage of bases with any coverage
- **Peak Coverage**: Maximum coverage observed

### **Assembly Quality Metrics**
- **N50**: Length of shortest contig at 50% of total assembly length
- **Contigs < 250bp**: Count and percentage of small contigs (quality indicator)
- **Total Bases**: Sum of all contig lengths

### **Mapping Quality Metrics**
- **Mapping Rate**: Percentage of reads that mapped to assembly
- **Properly Paired**: Reads mapping in correct orientation and distance
- **Mean Base Quality**: Average quality score of mapped bases
- **Mean Mapping Quality**: Average confidence in read mapping positions

## Integration with Snakemake

This script is designed to work within Snakemake workflows:

```python
rule coverage_visualization:
    input:
        coverage="{sample}/coverage_stats.txt",
        flagstat="{sample}/flagstat.txt"
    output:
        plot="{sample}/coverage_plot.png",
        summary="{sample}/coverage_summary.txt"
    shell:
        """
        python workflow/scripts/coverage_visualisation.py {input.coverage} {output.plot} \
            --sample {wildcards.sample} \
            --assembler spades \
            --flagstat {input.flagstat} \
            --summary {output.summary}
        """
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
   ```

2. **File Format Errors**
   - Ensure coverage file is tab-separated
   - Check that required columns are present
   - Verify file permissions and paths

3. **Memory Issues with Large Assemblies**
   - Script automatically closes plots to free memory
   - Consider filtering very small contigs if needed

4. **Plot Quality**
   - Output is saved at 300 DPI for publication quality
   - Use PNG for raster or PDF for vector graphics

### Performance Tips

- **Large assemblies**: Script handles millions of contigs efficiently
- **Memory usage**: Plots are closed automatically to conserve memory
- **File size**: Summary files are compact text format

## Example Use Cases

1. **Assembly Quality Assessment**: Compare coverage uniformity across different assemblers
2. **Sequencing Depth Analysis**: Evaluate if sequencing depth is sufficient
3. **Contamination Detection**: Identify contigs with unusual coverage patterns
4. **Assembly Optimization**: Guide parameter tuning for assembly tools
