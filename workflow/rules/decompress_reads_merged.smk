# this rule decompresses gzipped FASTQ files for SparseAssembler
# it is used to prepare the input for SparseAssembler, which requires uncompressed FASTQ files
# the output is a temporary file that will be used in the next steps of the workflow
# the input is expected to be gzipped FASTQ files with a specific naming convention
